Description: The assignment was to create a website using API calls from the Open Weather website. I was able to get the weather from the API, and update the website dynamically. I also added a feature to clear the users search history. I worked with a tutor on parts of this assignment, and found some really cool new ways to dynamically update CSS and HTML through the variables.
